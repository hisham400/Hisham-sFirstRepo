    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Hisham, and this website is part of my IB MYP Personal Project. I created it because football isn’t just a hobby for me — it’s something I truly love. Whether I’m watching matches, reading football blogs, or listening to match commentaries, I enjoy every second of it. Football makes me feel excited, and I wanted to share that feeling with others.</p>

    <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
    <p>While following football online, I noticed that many websites are very difficult to use, especially for younger fans or beginners. There’s too much information, confusing designs, and it's hard to know where to start. That’s when I had the idea to build my own website — one that is simple, fun, and easy to understand, especially for people who are just starting to follow the Premier League.</p>

    <h2>What This Website Offers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simple design</strong> – Easy to use and understand</li>
      <li><strong>Educational content</strong> – Learn about Premier League teams, players, history, and famous matches</li>
      <li><strong>Interactive features</strong> – Predict lineups, guess who will win the season, and join fun activities</li>
      <li><strong>Latest updates</strong> – Stay informed with recent match results, football news, and stats</li>
      <li><strong>Fun for everyone</strong> – Great for all football fans, especially beginners who want to enjoy the game more</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p><strong>My learning goal is:</strong> To learn how to code and build a real website from scratch. I spent time learning HTML, CSS, and how websites work to make this idea come to life.</p>
    <p><strong>My product goal is:</strong> To create a simple and exciting football website for young Premier League fans. I want people like me who love football to have a place where they can enjoy, learn, and have fun together.</p>
