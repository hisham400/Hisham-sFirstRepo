    <h1>English Premier League (EPL)</h1>

    <h2>History of EPL</h2>
    <img src="epl image.jpeg" alt=" class=" />
    <p>In the early 1990s, English First Division clubs believed that a radical restructuring of football was necessary if they and the game as a whole were to grow and succeed. As a result, on 17 July 1991, the clubs signed the Founder Members Agreement. This agreement laid out the basic principles for creating a new league that would give clubs more control and help football develop further.</p>
    <p>The new league, called the Premier League, would have commercial independence from the Football League and The FA. This meant it could organise its own broadcasting and sponsorship deals without interference. Then, on 20 February 1992, all 22 First Division clubs resigned from the Football League at the same time. Just a few months later, on 27 May 1992, the Premier League was officially formed as a limited company.</p>

    <p>One of the most important steps in the league’s early history was its first television deal. It was signed with pay-TV broadcaster BSkyB, which was a bold and unusual move at the time. However, Sky has remained a key partner and has played a major role in growing the league into what it is today.</p>

    <p>The inaugural Premier League season began on Saturday 15 August 1992, with 22 clubs. These founding clubs were Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and Wimbledon.</p>

    <p>Out of all these clubs, only six have remained in the Premier League every season since its creation. These are Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur. When the Premier League was created, there was also a long-term plan to reduce the number of teams from 22 to 20. This goal was finally achieved at the end of the 1994/95 season, when four clubs were relegated and only two clubs were promoted.</p>

    <h2>Structure of the EPL</h2>
    <img src="pl table.jpg_large" alt="Premier League Table" class="epl-image" />

    <p>The Premier League is the top tier of England's football pyramid, with 20 teams competing for the honour of being crowned English champions. It is home to some of the most famous clubs, players, managers, and stadiums in world football. The Premier League is also the most-watched league on the planet, reaching around 920 million homes in 189 countries.</p>

    <p>The league runs from August to May each year. During the season, each team plays the others twice — once at home and once away — for a total of 38 matches per team and 380 matches in total. Teams earn three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. The team with the most points at the end of the season wins the Premier League title.</p>

    <p>At the bottom of the table, the three lowest-placed teams are relegated to the Championship, which is the second tier of English football. They are replaced by three clubs from the Championship: the top two finishers and the winner of the end-of-season playoffs between the teams that finish third to sixth.</p>

    <p>If clubs finish with the same number of points, their position in the table is decided by goal difference. If that is also equal, the number of goals scored is considered next. After that, the head-to-head points between the clubs are used, followed by the number of away goals scored in those head-to-head matches.</p>

    <p>Since the Premier League began in 1992, seven different clubs have won the title: Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers, Leicester City, and Liverpool. Manchester United have been the most successful club, winning the league 13 times. Manchester City hold the record for the biggest title-winning margin, finishing 19 points ahead of Manchester United in the 2017/18 season. The narrowest winning margin came in 2011/12, when Manchester City won the title on goal difference, thanks to Sergio Aguero’s famous stoppage-time goal on the final day. Arsenal, under Arsène Wenger, are the only club to go an entire Premier League season unbeaten, achieving this in the 2003/04 season when they won the league by 11 points.</p>

    <h2>Most Successful Clubs</h2>
