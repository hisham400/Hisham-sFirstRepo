    <h2>History of EPL</h2>
    <p>In the early 1990s, English First Division clubs believed that a radical restructuring of football was necessary if they and the game as a whole were to grow and succeed. As a result, on 17 July 1991, the clubs signed the Founder Members Agreement. This agreement laid out the basic principles for creating a new league that would give clubs more control and help football develop further.</p>

    <p>The new league, called the Premier League, would have commercial independence from the Football League and The FA. This meant it could organise its own broadcasting and sponsorship deals without interference. Then, on 20 February 1992, all 22 First Division clubs resigned from the Football League at the same time. Just a few months later, on 27 May 1992, the Premier League was officially formed as a limited company.</p>

    <p>One of the most important steps in the league’s early history was its first television deal. It was signed with pay-TV broadcaster BSkyB, which was a bold and unusual move at the time. However, Sky has remained a key partner and has played a major role in growing the league into what it is today.</p>

    <p>The inaugural Premier League season began on Saturday 15 August 1992, with 22 clubs...</p>

    <h2>Structure of the EPL</h2>
    <p>The Premier League is the top tier of England's football pyramid, with 20 teams competing...</p>
